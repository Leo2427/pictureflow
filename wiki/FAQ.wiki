=Frequently Asked Questions=

*Help! !PictureFlow does not run on my device!*

You provide too little information. Please check [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html How To Ask Questions The Smart Way].

*I have problems building !PictureFlow. Can you help me?*

Please post your question to the [http://groups.google.com/group/pictureflow mailing-list].

*Can I use !PictureFlow with Python?*

The current stable version (0.1) does not offer Python support yet, expect this in the next version (0.2). Alternatively, you can use PyQt and SIP and generate the bindings by yourself. Please refer to PyQt and SIP documentations for details.

*Why can't !PictureFlow find my pictures?*

Pass the path/directory to the executable. Otherwise, PictureFlow will try to search the files in the current directory.

*Where to place the pictures so that !PictureFlow can find it? Is it /Program Files/pictureflow or /My Documents/pictureflow?*

See the previous question. It does really depend on your platform/system. You have to figure it by yourself.

*How can I install !PictureFlow on Windows? You don't provide any installer!*

You have to build it by yourself. Note that the intended audience of PictureFlow is _developers_, not _end-users_. It is just a normal Qt widget that needs to be used in a real application.

*Does PictureFlow run on Windows Mobile 5/6?*

Yes. See [http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2007/11/02/pictureflow-on-windows-mobile/ the proof video]. Note that you need to compile and test the program by yourself to try it out.
